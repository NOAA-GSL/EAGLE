Required Modules
-------------------------

Numerous packages are required to complete this pipeline:

- `ufs2arco` to create training, validation, and test datasets
- `anemoi-core` modules to train a graph-based model
- `anemoi-inference` to generate forecasts
- `wxvx` to verify model performance against gridded analysis or observations
- `eagle-tools` to help with various steps along the way

An overview of each module will be provided below.

Insert information about conda environment creation, that the EPIC team has made environments for users already, 
and any weird quirks that may pop up.
